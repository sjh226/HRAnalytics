### HR Analytics

Analytics based on overtime and vacation used by employees. Looking into whether
certain supervisors or business units are prone to overworking their employees or
denying vacation requests.

Initial Questions:
* Is there a correlation between any one supervisor and employees who actually
lose vacation days because they’ve rolled over the max and still aren’t taking any?
* Can we see if people schedule vacation, but actually submit hours for the days
they should be off?
* Can we see if there is a higher denial of vacation requests by certain team leaders?
* How many hourly employees regularly work more than 50 hours per week; are these
employees associated with any particular supervisor(s)?
